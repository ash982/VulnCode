This TypeScript example effectively demonstrates taint analysis concepts:

Tainted input is passed to multiple classes.
Class1 uses exec(), which can execute arbitrary commands.
Class2 constructs an SQL query without proper sanitization, potentially leading to SQL injection.


To run this code, you'd need to install the necessary dependencies and use ts-node:

npm install sqlite3 @types/sqlite3 ts-node typescript
ts-node main.ts "user input"
