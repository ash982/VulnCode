This PHP implementation demonstrates the same concepts as the previous examples:

Tainted input is passed to multiple classes.
Class1 uses system(), which can execute arbitrary commands.
Class2 constructs an SQL query without proper sanitization, which could lead to SQL injection.
Class2 includes database connection functionality using SQLite via PDO.


To run this code, you would use:

php main.php "user input"
