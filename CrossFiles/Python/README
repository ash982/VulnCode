This Python implementation demonstrates the same concepts as the C version:

Tainted input is passed to multiple classes.
Class1 uses os.system(), which can execute arbitrary commands.
Class2 constructs an SQL query without proper sanitization, which could lead to SQL injection.
Class2 includes database connection functionality using SQLite.


To use this code, you would run it from the command line like this:

python main.py "user input"
