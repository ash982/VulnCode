This JavaScript implementation showcases the same concepts as the previous examples:

Tainted input is passed to multiple classes.
Class1 uses exec(), which can execute arbitrary commands.
Class2 constructs an SQL query without proper sanitization, potentially leading to SQL injection.
Class2 includes database connection functionality using SQLite.


To run this code, you'll need to install the sqlite3 package:

npm install sqlite3
