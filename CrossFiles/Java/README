This Java implementation effectively demonstrates taint analysis concepts:

Tainted input is passed to multiple classes.
Class1 uses Runtime.exec(), which can execute arbitrary commands.
Class2 constructs an SQL query without proper sanitization, potentially leading to SQL injection.


To run this code, you would compile and execute it like this:

javac Main.java Class1.java Class2.java
java Main "user input"
