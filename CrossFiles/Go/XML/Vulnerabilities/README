Vulnerabilities when parsing untrusted or potentially malicious XML: 

1) XML Entity Injection (internal and external entity):
Remediation: Disable entity parsing

2) Denial of Service (DoS) from excessively large or deeply nested XML (XML Bomb/Billion Laughs Attack):
Remediation: Limit Input Size and Complexity: Implement checks to restrict the size and nesting depth of XML documents to prevent DoS attacks.

3) Round-trip Vulnerabilities
Remediation: 
Avoid Round-trips. If possible, avoid parsing and re-serializing XML data, as this can introduce vulnerabilities. 
If round-trips are necessary, carefully validate and sanitize the data before and after each step.
