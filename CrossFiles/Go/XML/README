Go XML Injection
references: https://owasp.org/www-chapter-vancouver/assets/presentations/2020-08_Golang_XXE.pdf

1. Native XML parser
1.1 xml.Unmarshal
Usage Scenario
simple cases where the entire XML content is readily available in memory and security concerns are minimal

1.2 xml.NewDecoder
Usage Scenario
handling large XML files, streaming data, or when security is paramount, as it allows for more control over the parsing process and resource management.


Vulnerabilities:
1) XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:
Disable entity

2) Denial of Service (DoS) from excessively large or deeply nested XML (XML Bomb/Billion Laughs Attack):
Limit Input Size and Complexity: Implement checks to restrict the size and nesting depth of XML documents to prevent DoS attacks.

3) Round-trip Vulnerabilities
Avoid Round-trips:
If possible, avoid parsing and re-serializing XML data, as this can introduce vulnerabilities. If round-trips are necessary, carefully validate and sanitize the data before and after each step.


2. 3rd party parser
