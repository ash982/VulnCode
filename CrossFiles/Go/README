This Go implementation effectively demonstrates the taint analysis concepts:

Tainted input is passed to multiple structs (Go's equivalent of classes).
Class1 uses exec.Command(), which can execute arbitrary commands.
Class2 constructs an SQL query without proper sanitization, potentially leading to SQL injection.

To run this code, you'd need to install the SQLite driver for Go:

go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
go run main.go class1.go class2.go "user input"
