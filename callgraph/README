A PHP application that takes user input in home.php, validates it using one class, enriches it with the user's IP and a timestamp using another class, and then displays the result on the same page.

Explanation

Input Handling:
User inputs text in a form on home.php.
The form submits data to the same page using the POST method.

Validation:
Validator::validateInput() ensures the input is trimmed, not empty, not excessively long, and sanitized for XSS.

Enrichment:
Enricher::enrichInput() adds metadata: the user's IP address and the current timestamp.

Result Display:
If validation passes, the enriched data is displayed below the form.
Errors are caught and displayed in a red message.

================================
Test Case
Navigate to home.php.
Enter valid and invalid inputs to see how validation and enrichment behave.
View enriched data (user's IP and timestamp).
This approach maintains a clean separation of concerns while keeping the process simple and extendable.
