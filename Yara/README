A YARA rule is a set of instructions that defines the characteristics of a specific malware or threat, allowing it to be detected and classified. It uses a C-like syntax to describe patterns within files, which can include text, hexadecimal strings, or regular expressions. YARA rules are typically used in malware research and detection to identify specific threat families or behaviors.
