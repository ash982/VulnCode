OS module os.exec*

All those methods with "exec" in their names in the os module are related to executing commands, but they function in a specific way:
The os.exec* family of functions replace the current Python process with a new program. This means your Python script stops running, and the specified program takes over the process completely. They don't return unless there's an error.

Key characteristics:

1.They replace the current process, not create a new one
2.They don't return control to your Python program (unlike os.system or subprocess functions)
3.Different variants handle arguments and environment variables differently:
  os.execl, os.execv: Basic versions
  os.execlp, os.execvp: Search for the executable in PATH
  os.execle, os.execve: Allow specifying environment variables
  os.execlpe, os.execvpe: Combine PATH search and environment variables

These differ from other command execution methods like:
  os.system(): Runs a command and waits for it to complete, returning the exit status
  os.popen(): Runs a command and provides a file-like object to read its output
  subprocess module functions: More flexible ways to spawn new processes, capture output, etc.

If you need to run a command and continue your Python program afterward, you should use the subprocess module instead of the os.exec* functions.


================================================
OS module os.exec*

spawnl
spawnle
spawnlp
spawnlpe
spawnv
spawnve
spawnvp
spawnvpe

These spawn* functions, unlike the exec* functions, create a new process rather than replacing the current one. They execute a program and return the process ID of the new process to the calling program.

The naming conventions follow a similar pattern to the exec* functions:

 l vs v: Arguments as individual parameters vs as a list/tuple
 p: Search for the program in the PATH environment variable
 e: Allow specifying environment variables
Note that these functions are primarily available on Windows. On Unix-like systems, you would typically use os.fork() and os.exec*() or the subprocess module instead.

================================================
"system", "popen", "spawn*", "exec*", and "startfile".
