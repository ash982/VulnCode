API Gateway Invoking Lambda Functions:
API Gateway can invoke AWS Lambda functions through an integration setup. Here's a comprehensive explanation of how this works:

Overview of the Integration:
API Gateway invokes Lambda functions through a request-response model:
1.A client sends a request to an API Gateway endpoint
2.API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to the connected Lambda function
3.The Lambda function processes the request and returns a response
4.API Gateway receives the Lambda response and forwards it back to the client

Integration Types:
API Gateway offers two main integration types for Lambda:
1.Lambda Proxy Integration (AWS_PROXY) - Passes the entire request to Lambda without modification
2.Lambda Custom Integration (AWS) - Allows you to transform the request/response using mapping templates

How to Set Up Lambda Integration:
Using the AWS Console
1.Create a Lambda function
2.Create an API Gateway REST API
3.Create a resource and method (GET, POST, etc.)
4.Set up Lambda integration
