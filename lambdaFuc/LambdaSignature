To determine if a given function is an AWS Lambda function handler, there are several characteristics to look for:

1. The most obvious sign is the function name lambda_handler, which is a common convention for AWS Lambda handlers in Python (but can be any function name).

2. The parameter signature with event and context parameters is the standard signature for AWS Lambda handlers (typically 'event' and 'context' but can be any parameter names).
   The pattern you provided def lambda_handler(event, context): is indeed the standard signature for an AWS Lambda function handler in Python. 
   AWS Lambda looks for this specific function name by default when executing Python code, though you can configure a different handler name if needed.

3. Order of parameters: first one is event, the 2nd one is context

4. Number of parameters: should be 2

5. Additional context can help confirm it, such as:
   .Is it in a file that's deployed to AWS Lambda?
   .Does the function contain logic to process an event and return a response?
   .If it behind AWS API Gateway, check .hcl, .yaml. .tf configuration files (configuration files define and configure infrastructure resources)
