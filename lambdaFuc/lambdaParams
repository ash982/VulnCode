1. Security Considerations for AWS Lambda Event and Context:
In an AWS Lambda function with the signature "def lambda_handler(event, context)", the event parameter typically contains user-controlled data, 
while the context parameter is controlled by AWS.

1.1 Event Parameter

The event parameter is considered user-controllable because:
1.1.1 It contains the data that triggers your Lambda function 
1.1.2 Depending on your Lambda's trigger source, it may contain:
  Direct user input (e.g., from API Gateway)
  Data from services that could originate from users (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
  Messages from queues (SQS) or streams (Kinesis) that might contain user data

1.1.3 Security Implications:

You should always validate and sanitize data from the event parameter
Treat event data as untrusted and potentially malicious
Apply input validation, parameter checking, and proper encoding

1.2 Context Parameter https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-context.html
The context parameter is AWS-controlled and contains:

  Runtime information about the Lambda execution environment
  Function metadata (name, version, memory limits, etc.)
  AWS request IDs and other operational data

While the context object is not directly user-controllable, some values might reflect user behavior (like request IDs tied to specific invocations).

def my_handler(event, context):
  my_custom_dict = context.client_context.custom
#####################################

The client_context object typically contains the following properties:

.client - Information about the client application
.custom - A dictionary for custom values set by the mobile client application
.env - Environment information from the AWS Mobile SDK

The code is accessing the custom dictionary from the client_context object. This custom dictionary contains user-defined values that were sent by the client application when invoking the Lambda function.
client_context is only available when the function is invoked from the AWS Mobile SDK or AWS IoT.

If your Lambda function is invoked through other means (such as the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or another AWS service), client_context might be None, which could cause your code to throw an error if it tries to access attributes without checking first.

You should typically add validation before accessing client_context.





Summary 
When handling Lambda functions, always implement:

  Proper input validation
  Least privilege permissions for your Lambda function
  Parameter type checking
  Output encoding when returning responses
  Protection against injection attacks (SQL, command, etc.)
