1. GraphQL - Choose a Framework/Library
Depending on your language, here are popular GraphQL implementations:

JavaScript/Node.js: apollo-server, express-graphql
Python: graphene, ariadne (These two are following different approaches - Ariadne is using schema first pattern and Graphene - code first, which means that schema is generated by code, specifically, by Python classes. Ariadne seems to be a much simpler approach not suited for more sophisticated use cases therefore it is not evaluated further.)
Java: graphql-java 
Ruby: graphql-ruby
PHP: graphql-php
Go: gqlgen


2. Best Practices
Structure your schema well: Group related fields, use interfaces and unions for complex types.

Use pagination: For large collections, implement cursor-based pagination.

Optimize resolvers: Avoid N+1 query problems using DataLoader.

Versioning: GraphQL schema doesn't need explicit versioning; evolve it gradually.

Use fragments: Encourage clients to use fragments for reusable parts of queries.

Security: Implement depth limiting, query complexity analysis, and rate limiting.

Documentation: Use schema descriptions to document your API.

Testing: Write tests for your schema and resolvers.
