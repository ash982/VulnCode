1. Choose a Framework/Library
Depending on your language, here are popular GraphQL implementations:

JavaScript/Node.js: apollo-server, express-graphql
Python: graphene, ariadne (These two are following different approaches - Ariadne is using schema first pattern and Graphene - code first, which means that schema is generated by code, specifically, by Python classes. Ariadne seems to be a much simpler approach not suited for more sophisticated use cases therefore it is not evaluated further.)
Java: graphql-java 
Ruby: graphql-ruby
PHP: graphql-php
Go: gqlgen
