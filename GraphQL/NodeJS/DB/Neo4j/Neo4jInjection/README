Neo4j Injection Prevention
1. Use Parameterized Queries
The most important defense against Neo4j Cypher injection is to use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.

2. Use neo4j-graphql-js Properly
The neo4j-graphql-js library handles parameterization internally when using @cypher directives, making it safer

3. Input Validation
Always validate and sanitize input before sending it to Neo4j
