Optimizations and Best Practices
Connection Pooling: Both your Neo4j and MySQL connections should use connection pooling for better performance.

Batching Requests: Implement DataLoader to batch and cache database requests.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for both database connections.

Transactions: Use transactions when performing multiple operations on either database.

Schema Stitching: Consider more advanced schema stitching for complex apps.

By following this approach, you can create a GraphQL API that seamlessly integrates data from both Neo4j (graph database) and MySQL (relational database), providing a unified interface for your clients.
