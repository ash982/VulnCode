**Templating engines that share features, syntax, or philosophy with Jinja2**
Here are several template engines similar to Jinja, categorized by the language they are primarily associated with:

**Cross-Language/Similar Syntax**
These engines often have a syntax similar to Jinja's {{ variable }} and {% statement %} and are available in multiple languages:

Mustache üë®‚Äç moustache: Known as a "logic-less" template engine. It focuses on separating logic from presentation and has implementations 
in dozens of languages (JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, etc.).

Handlebars üê¥: An extension of Mustache. It provides a bit more functionality, often described as "logic-lite," 
making it similar to Jinja's approach of keeping complex logic out of the template but allowing for basic helpers. Primarily used in JavaScript.

**Language-Specific Alternatives**
Python (Jinja's Native Environment)
While Jinja is the de facto standard in Python (especially with Flask and Django), other alternatives exist:

Django Template Language (DTL): The default template engine for the Django framework. Jinja's syntax and features (like template inheritance) are largely inspired by DTL, making them very similar. The main difference is that DTL is intentionally less flexible for complex logic inside the template.

Mako: A powerful, high-performance templating engine for Python. It allows for embedding full Python code directly into templates, which is a major difference from Jinja's restricted syntax. It's often used with frameworks like Pyramid.

JavaScript/Node.js
These engines are often ports or direct inspiration from Jinja/Twig:

Nunjucks: A very close port of Jinja2 for JavaScript, created by Mozilla. It aims to be feature-complete and provides almost all of Jinja's features, including template inheritance, block, and macro support.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It's often compared to PHP or Ruby's ERB.

PHP
Twig üå≥: The default template engine for the popular PHP framework Symfony. Twig was developed by the same person who created Jinja, and it shares a virtually identical syntax and feature set (inheritance, macros, filters, etc.), making it the closest functional equivalent to Jinja in the PHP ecosystem.

In short, if you like Jinja's features and philosophy (template inheritance, clear separation of concerns), you'll likely find Twig (for PHP) and Nunjucks (for JavaScript) to be the most similar in terms of syntax and functionality.
