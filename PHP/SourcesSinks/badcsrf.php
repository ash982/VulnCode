//The statement highlights a security risk associated with PHP's $_REQUEST superglobal, specifically how its automatic and un-ordered combination of data from $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE 
can be exploited in a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. 

Here is a breakdown of why this happens.
How $_REQUEST works

By default, the $_REQUEST superglobal is populated by merging the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.
The order of precedence for which data source overwrites another is determined by the request_order and variables_order settings in the php.ini file. 
A common and problematic default order is GPC, meaning $_GET variables are overwritten by $_POST variables, and both are overwritten by $_COOKIE variables. This precedence is the key to the vulnerability. 

The CSRF attack vector
Imagine a bank website with a form that uses the POST method for a transfer. The form is properly secured with an anti-CSRF token, which is a secret, un-guessable value stored in a hidden form field 
to prevent an attacker from forging a request. 

The developer's intention:
php
if ($_POST['csrf_token'] === $_SESSION['csrf_token']) {
    // Process the transaction
}
Use code with caution.

The attacker's approach:
1.The attacker crafts a malicious website containing JavaScript that sets a cookie on the victim's browser. The cookie is named csrf_token and has a value that the attacker knows (e.g., csrf_token=eviltoken).
2.The attacker tricks the victim into visiting the malicious website while they are logged into their bank account.
3.The attacker's page then submits a legitimate-looking POST form to the bank's site to initiate a transaction, like transferring money to the attacker. 

The vulnerability with $_REQUEST:
1.The bank's legitimate POST form contains a valid, session-specific CSRF token in a hidden field, like <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="legittoken">.
2.However, when the bank's server-side script retrieves the token via $_REQUEST['csrf_token'], the cookie value of "eviltoken" overrides the POST value of "legittoken" due to the GPC precedence order.
3.The validation $_REQUEST['csrf_token'] === $_SESSION['csrf_token'] will now fail because eviltoken does not match the session token.
4.The attack is thwarted, but in a non-obvious way. 
The real vulnerability lies in a different scenario: if the developer had accidentally retrieved the session token from a user-controlled source. 


The most dangerous scenario: Cookie overwrites a GET/POST value
This scenario is the most straightforward demonstration of the risk. 
1.An attacker tricks a user into visiting their malicious site.
2.The malicious site contains a script that sets a cookie in the user's browser, for example, user_id=attacker_id.
3.Later, the user visits the legitimate site and a script reads the user_id from $_REQUEST.
4.Even if the user submits a POST form with their own ID, $_REQUEST will use the attacker's cookie value, potentially making it appear as if the attacker is authenticated. 

The key takeaway
Using $_REQUEST is problematic because it introduces ambiguity about the origin of the data. An explicit approach is far safer and clearer. 

| Situation |	Explicit Approach (Safer) |	Ambiguous Approach (Risky)
| User Input (Form) |	Use $_POST (for state-changing actions) or $_GET (for filtering).	| Use $_REQUEST. An attacker can manipulate a cookie or URL parameter to override the expected form value.
| Authentication Token |	Use $_POST for the form field and a server-stored session variable for the check.	| Use $_REQUEST for the check. An attacker-controlled cookie could overwrite the token, leading to vulnerabilities or denial of service for the user.
