CGI programs can be written in virtually any programming language that can read from standard input, write to standard output, and access environment variables, 
though Perl and C/C++ are historically popular choices. Other common languages for CGI include Python, PHP, Ruby, and various shell scripts like Bash. 

How CGI Works
CGI isn't a language but a standard interface that allows web servers to execute external programs (scripts) to generate dynamic content. 
The web server passes information to the CGI program via environment variables and standard input, and the program sends its response back to 
the web server on standard output. 

=========================================================================================
To use a Perl script as a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) program, follow these steps:
1. Shebang Line: Begin the Perl script with a shebang line that specifies the path to the Perl interpreter on your server. For example:
    #!/usr/bin/perl

(Adjust the path if your Perl interpreter is located elsewhere.)

2. CGI Module (Optional but Recommended): Use the CGI module to simplify handling HTTP requests and generating responses.

    use CGI;
    my $q = CGI->new;

3. Content-Type Header: The script must output a Content-type header followed by two newline characters before any other output. This tells the web server what type of content the script is sending to the browser.

    print $q->header('text/html');

Or, without the CGI module:

    print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

4. HTML Output: Generate the desired HTML content that will be sent to the user's browser.

    print "<html><head><title>My CGI Script</title></head><body>\n";
    print "<h1>Hello from Perl CGI!</h1>\n";
    print "</body></html>\n";

5. Permissions: Ensure the Perl script has executable permissions on the web server. Typically, this means setting permissions to 755.
Code

    chmod 755 your_script.pl

6. CGI-BIN Directory: Place the script in a directory configured for CGI execution, often named cgi-bin, which is typically located within the web server's document root.

7. Web Server Configuration: Configure your web server (e.g., Apache) to recognize and execute Perl scripts in the designated CGI directory. This usually involves directives like ScriptAlias and Options +ExecCGI in the server's configuration file.

Example Perl CGI Script:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;
use strict;
use warnings;

my $q = CGI->new;

print $q->header('text/html');

my $name = $q->param('name') || 'Guest'; # Get 'name' parameter, default to 'Guest'

print <<HTML;
<html>
<head>
    <title>Perl CGI Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, $name!</h1>
    <form method="get" action="\$0">
        Enter your name: <input type="text" name="name">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
