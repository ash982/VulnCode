Authentication in CGI is done by having the web server (or an external service) handle user login and then providing the CGI script with information about the authenticated user 
through environment variables. Alternatively, a CGI script can generate an HTML login form and then use server-side code to validate credentials against a stored list or 
an external authentication system. This process ensures that only authorized users can access CGI-protected resources. 

Web Server-Level Authentication
Configure Authentication Type: In the web server configuration (often using .htaccess files for Apache), set the AuthType to a method like WebAuth or Basic. 
Specify Access Restrictions: Use directives like require valid-user to restrict access to a specific directory or file to authenticated users. 
User Interaction: When a user tries to access the CGI script, the web server intercepts the request and prompts the user to enter their username and password. 
Provide User Information: If authentication is successful, the web server sets environment variables (like WEBAUTH_USER for WebAuth) containing the user's details before the CGI script is executed. 
Access to User Data: The CGI script can then access these environment variables to know who the current user is. 

CGI Script-Based Authentication
Create a Login Form: The CGI script itself generates and displays an HTML login form to the user. 
Handle Credentials: The script receives the username and password from the submitted form. 
Validate Credentials: The script then validates these credentials against a local password file or by sending them to an external authentication system, such as a ticket-based system or a central identity provider. 
Set User Session: If authentication succeeds, the script can then establish a session for the user and continue to provide access to the requested resource. 
Redirect to Resource: After successful authentication, the user is typically redirected to the resource they were initially trying to access.
