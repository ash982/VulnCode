A Lua file is a plain text file containing source code written in the Lua programming language. These files, typically identified by the .lua file extension, serve as scripts or modules that define instructions and logic for applications or programs that embed the Lua interpreter.

Key characteristics of Lua files:
Scripting Language: Lua is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language often used for configuration, rapid prototyping, and extending functionality within larger applications, particularly in areas like game development (e.g., Roblox, World of Warcraft), web applications, and embedded systems.
Plain Text: Lua files are human-readable and can be created and edited using any standard text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code).
Source Code: The content of a .lua file comprises Lua code, which includes variables, functions, control structures (like loops and conditionals), and data structures (primarily tables).
Interpreter-based Execution: Lua code within a .lua file is executed by a Lua interpreter, which translates the code into instructions that the host program or system can understand and act upon.
Embeddability: The design of Lua emphasizes its ability to be easily integrated into other applications written in languages like C or C++, allowing developers to add flexible scripting capabilities without significantly increasing application size or complexity.
