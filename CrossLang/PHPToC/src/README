Example SWIG Interface File
====================================================================================
command.i Explanation:
%{...%} Block:
Code inside %{...%} is copied verbatim into the generated wrapper file (command_wrap.c).
Including #include "command.h" here ensures that the C wrapper code generated by SWIG has access to the function declarations in your header file.

%include "command.h":
This tells SWIG to parse the declarations in the header file. SWIG uses this to generate the bindings for the functions declared in command.h.

No Need for extern:
Since the function is already declared in the header file, there's no need to repeat the declaration explicitly in the SWIG file.
====================================================================================
command2.i Explanation:
%module command: Sets the module name (command in this case). This determines how the module is accessed in PHP (e.g., dl("command.so")).
%{ ... %}: The code block inside %{ %} is copied verbatim into the generated wrapper file (command_wrap.c). This includes the necessary header file for the function implementation.
extern Declaration: Explicitly specifies the function signature for SWIG to wrap.
