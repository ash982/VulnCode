================================================================================================
File Details
1. src/ Directory
This directory contains the source code for the C implementation and SWIG interface file.

command.c: The implementation of the C function(s).
command.h: The header file declaring the function(s).
command.i: The SWIG interface file that bridges C and PHP.

2. build/ Directory
This directory contains all the generated and compiled files.

command_wrap.c: The wrapper code generated by SWIG.
command.so: The compiled shared library (PHP extension).

3. php/ Directory
This directory contains PHP-related files.

index.php: The PHP script for user interaction (e.g., a form to accept input and call the C function).
command.php: The PHP extension file generated by SWIG to expose the C function.

4. config/ Directory
php.ini: PHP configuration file for local development, including the extension=command.so line to enable your extension.

5. README.md
Documentation for the project, including setup instructions, usage examples, and security considerations.

6. Makefile
Automates the build process for the project, making it easier to compile the shared library.

=======================================
Steps to Build and Run
1.Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash code:
cd project


2.Build the Project: Use the Makefile to generate the wrapper and compile the shared library:

bash code:
make

3. Add the Extension to PHP:

Move command.so to the PHP extensions directory or update php.ini to include the full path to the file.

Example line for php.ini:
ini code:
extension=/path/to/project/build/command.so

4. Restart PHP: Restart your PHP service or web server to apply the changes.

5. Test the PHP Script: Run php/index.php from the browser or command line.
