The extra comma in params = (flag_name, app, release_version,) is a Python syntax convention for creating tuples.

In Python, this trailing comma after the last element of a tuple (or list, or dictionary) is optional but has some benefits:

1. Readability and maintainability: It makes it clear that the structure is a tuple, especially when it spans multiple lines.

2. Version control friendliness: When you need to add another parameter later, the diff will only show the added line, not a change to the existing line:

3. Consistent style: Many Python style guides (including Google's and some interpretations of PEP 8) recommend this style, particularly for multi-line collections.

4. Single-element tuple clarity: While not applicable in this case (since there are three elements), for a single-element tuple, the trailing comma is required to distinguish it from a parenthesized expression: (element,) vs (element).
