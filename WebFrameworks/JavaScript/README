Here's an overview of popular frameworks in both domains:

Client-side frameworks:
  React: Known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM
  Angular: A comprehensive framework with powerful features for large-scale applications
  Vue.js: Praised for its simplicity and gentle learning curve
  Svelte: Offers a unique approach to building user interfaces with less boilerplate
  Ember.js: Provides a complete solution for building ambitious web applications
  Handlebars
  SAPUI5: from SAP. It is primarily a client-side JavaScript framework. It's designed to run in the browser. It has built-in support for OData, facilitating communication with server-side data sources.

Server-side frameworks:
  Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
  Next.js: React framework for production-grade applications with server-side rendering
  Nest.js: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications
  Koa.js: Expressive middleware for Node.js using async functions
  Hapi.js: A powerful framework for building scalable applications and services

GRANDstack(Graphs All the Way Down):
GRANDstack is a full-stack framework for building applications with GraphQL, React, Apollo and the Neo4j Database.
GraphQL is our API layer, and React is a JavaScript UI library for creating user interfaces on web, mobile and now in VR. Apollo is a suite of tools that makes it easier to use GraphQL both on the client and the server. 
Lastly, the Neo4j database is a opens in new tabnative graph database.
The Neo4j GraphQL Library provides a seamless way to integrate GraphQL APIs with a Neo4j graph database. 
It simplifies the development of API backends by automatically translating GraphQL queries into Cypher, Neo4j's native query language.


These frameworks demonstrate JavaScript's strength in creating robust, efficient applications across the full stack. 
Each offers unique features and advantages, allowing developers to choose the best tool for their specific project requirements.
