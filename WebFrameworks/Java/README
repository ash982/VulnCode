Here are some popular Java web frameworks:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) framework:
JAX-RS is a specification for creating RESTful web services in Java. The @Path annotation is used to define the URI path for a resource or a method within a resource class, 
mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific Java methods.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Boot: Streamlines the setup of Spring-based applications, highly favored for microservices.
JavaServer Faces (JSF): A component-based UI framework for building web applications.
Struts: An mature MVC framework that's still widely used in enterprise applications.

How does Spring's @RequestMapping differ from JAX-RS @Path?
When comparing Spring's @RequestMapping to JAX-RS @Path, it's important to understand the fundamental difference: JAX-RS is a specification, while Spring is a complete framework. 
1. Framework and ecosystem
JAX-RS: This is a Java API for RESTful Web Services, a part of the Java EE standard. It provides a specification for building REST services using annotations. It requires a compatible implementation (like Jersey, RESTEasy, Apache CXF) to be used.
Spring: A full framework that includes Spring MVC, which provides the capabilities for creating web and RESTful services. It offers a comprehensive ecosystem with features like dependency injection, security, ORM, etc., according to Baeldung. 
2. Core purpose of annotations
JAX-RS @Path: Defines the base URI path for a resource class or the relative URI path for a method within that class.
Spring @RequestMapping: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods in Spring MVC controllers. It can be applied at both the class and method levels to define URL patterns and narrow down mappings based on various criteria like HTTP methods, request parameters, headers, and media types. 
3. Level of flexibility in mapping
JAX-RS @Path: Primarily focuses on defining the URI path for a resource.
Spring @RequestMapping: Offers a broader set of attributes beyond just the path, allowing for flexible mapping based on HTTP methods (e.g., @GetMapping, @PostMapping), parameters, and headers, according to the Spring documentation. 
4. Handling of HTTP methods
JAX-RS: Uses annotations like @GET, @POST, @PUT, @DELETE, and @HEAD to specify the HTTP method for a resource method.
Spring: Uses the method attribute of @RequestMapping or specialized annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc., to define the supported HTTP methods for a handler method, according to the Spring documentation. 
5. Integration with other features
JAX-RS: Works well when used with a DI framework like Spring or Guice, and allows for creating JSON/XML REST layers.
Spring: Easily integrates with other modules of the Spring ecosystem like Spring Security, Spring Data REST, etc. 
6. Testing
Spring: Spring MVC allows for unit testing using MockMVC, which provides a nicer testing framework according to a Reddit user.
JAX-RS: MockMVC only works with Spring MVC. 
In essence, while both @Path and @RequestMapping serve the fundamental purpose of mapping URLs to code, @RequestMapping in Spring MVC offers more control over various aspects of the request, such as HTTP methods, headers, and parameters, within the context of a comprehensive framework. JAX-RS focuses on providing a standard specification that can be implemented by different frameworks.

Explain how a request is routed to a handler method in Spring MVC
Here's how a request is routed to a handler method in Spring MVC:
1. The DispatcherServlet as Front Controller
All incoming HTTP requests to a Spring MVC application are first intercepted by a central servlet called the DispatcherServlet.
It acts as the single entry point for the application and orchestrates the entire request processing lifecycle.
The DispatcherServlet is configured in the web.xml (or using Java configuration) to define which URL patterns it should handle. 
2. Handler Mapping
The DispatcherServlet consults a HandlerMapping implementation to determine the appropriate handler (controller method) that should handle the incoming request.
HandlerMappings are responsible for mapping requests to controllers based on various criteria, such as URL patterns, HTTP methods, request parameters, and headers.
The most common HandlerMapping used with annotation-based controllers is RequestMappingHandlerMapping, which uses the @RequestMapping and its specialized variants (like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.) to define the mappings.
It checks the requested URL against the URL patterns defined in the @RequestMapping annotations in the controller classes.
Spring also checks the HTTP method of the incoming request against the methods specified in the annotations.
If multiple handlers match, Spring uses a "best match" selection algorithm, favoring more specific matches based on factors like the number of URI variables and wildcards. 
3. Controller Invocation
Once the HandlerMapping identifies the appropriate controller method, the DispatcherServlet uses a HandlerAdapter to actually invoke that method.
The HandlerAdapter acts as a bridge, decoupling the DispatcherServlet from the specifics of how the controller method is invoked (e.g., handling different parameter types).
RequestMappingHandlerAdapter is the default adapter used for annotated controllers.
The adapter retrieves the HandlerMethod from the mapping registry and invokes it using reflection. 
4. Argument Resolution and Method Invocation
Before invoking the handler method, the RequestMappingHandlerAdapter needs to populate the method's parameters.
It inspects the method signature for annotations like @PathVariable and @RequestParam.
Based on these annotations and parameter types, Spring selects the corresponding argument resolvers.
These resolvers extract the relevant data from the request (e.g., path variables, query parameters, request body) and convert them to the correct Java types.
The converted values are then injected into the method arguments, and the handler method is finally invoked. 
5. Return Value Processing
After the handler method completes its execution, it returns a value (e.g., a ModelAndView object, a domain object, a String representing a view name).
The HandlerAdapter processes this return value.
If the method returns a ModelAndView or a view name, the DispatcherServlet engages a ViewResolver to translate the logical view name into an actual view implementation (like a JSP or Thymeleaf template).
For RESTful services, if the method returns a domain object (and the controller is annotated with @RestController or the method with @ResponseBody), Spring uses HttpMessageConverters (like MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter for JSON) to serialize the object into the appropriate response format. 
6. Response Generation
Finally, the DispatcherServlet renders the view (if applicable) with the model data and sends the response back to the client.
The response is the generated HTML, JSON, XML, or other content type, according to Medium. 
This entire process, driven by the DispatcherServlet, allows Spring MVC to handle incoming requests efficiently, map them to the correct handler methods, and generate appropriate responses, according to Vinotech.

Play Framework: Focuses on developer productivity with hot reloading and a stateless architecture.  
API handlers (routes) are defined in the conf/routes file. This file acts as the router configuration, mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific controller actions that handle those requests.
.Play 1.x router annotations (deprecated)
It's important to note that the Play Router Annotations module, which allowed defining routes directly in the controllers using annotations like @Get, @Post, etc., is for Play 1.x series only and is now considered deprecated. 
.In Play 2.x and later, the conf/routes file remains the central place for defining routes, while annotations are primarily used for cross-cutting concerns like security, logging, and validation, rather than directly mapping HTTP methods to controller actions.
