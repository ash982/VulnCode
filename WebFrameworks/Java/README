Here are some popular Java web frameworks:

Spring Boot: Streamlines the setup of Spring-based applications, highly favored for microservices.
JavaServer Faces (JSF): A component-based UI framework for building web applications.
Struts: An mature MVC framework that's still widely used in enterprise applications.
Play Framework: Focuses on developer productivity with hot reloading and a stateless architecture.
Vaadin: Enables building web apps using Java without extensive HTML or JavaScript knowledge.
Grails: A Groovy-based web application framework emphasizing rapid development.
Dropwizard: Excellent for creating RESTful web services quickly and efficiently.
Spark Java: A micro-framework well-suited for creating small, fast web applications.
Vert.x: A toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM, known for its high performance.
Micronaut: Designed for building modular, easily testable microservice applications.

These frameworks showcase Java's versatility in web development, offering developers powerful tools to create robust, scalable, and efficient web applications across various project sizes and requirements.

Jelly is an interesting and versatile XML processing framework for Java. 
Here are some key points about Jelly:

XML-based scripting engine: Jelly allows developers to turn XML into executable code.
Extensible tag library: It provides a rich set of tags for various operations, and developers can create custom tags.
Integration with Java: Jelly scripts can easily interact with Java objects and methods.
Template engine: It's often used for generating dynamic content and templating.
Part of Apache Commons: Jelly is maintained as part of the Apache Commons project, ensuring ongoing development and community support.
Flexible use cases: It's utilized in build processes, generating reports, and creating dynamic web content.

Jelly offers a unique approach to XML processing and scripting in Java environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it a valuable tool for developers working on projects that involve XML manipulation or require a powerful templating system. 
While it may not be as widely used as some other frameworks, Jelly continues to serve specific niches effectively in the Java ecosystem.

Jelly is not primarily a web framework, but rather a versatile XML processing tool that can be used in web development contexts. It excels as an XML-based scripting engine and template processor, offering unique capabilities for generating dynamic content.
While Jelly can contribute to web application development, especially in areas like content generation and templating, it's more accurately described as a complementary technology that can enhance web development processes rather than a full-fledged web framework. 
Its flexibility allows it to integrate well with other Java-based web technologies, making it a valuable addition to a developer's toolkit for specific XML-related tasks in web projects.
