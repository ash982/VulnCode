Can swap16 and swap32 lead to buffer overflow?

The short answer is: No, a SWAP16 or SWAP32 instruction itself cannot cause a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow is caused by a write operation that goes beyond the bounds of a buffer. The SWAP instructions simply operate on data that is already within a specific memory location.
The more nuanced and important answer is: Incorrectly using or failing to use SWAP instructions when processing network or file data can be a contributing factor to a buffer overflow.

Let's break down how this can happen.
The Problem: Mismatched Assumptions
The core issue is a mismatch between the data's size in its source format (e.g., network byte order) and the size the program expects it to have. A malicious actor can exploit this mismatch.

Consider a simple scenario where a program reads a packet from the network:
A header field specifies the length of the data to follow. This length is a 16-bit or 32-bit integer. Let's say it's a 32-bit integer.
The program reads this 32-bit length field.
The program then uses this length to allocate a buffer or to determine how much data to copy into an existing buffer.

Now, imagine the program is running on a little-endian machine, but it fails to convert the 32-bit length field from big-endian (network byte order) to little-endian (host byte order).
Legitimate scenario: The length field is 0x00000100 (big-endian). The program converts it correctly using ntohl. The result is 256 (decimal). It allocates a buffer of 256 bytes. Everything works as expected.
Vulnerability scenario: A malicious user sends a packet where the length field is 0x80000000 (big-endian).
The programmer's intent: The value 0x80000000 is a very large number, and the programmer probably has a check like if (length > MAX_SIZE) { ... }.

The bug: The programmer forgets to use ntohl to convert the value. The little-endian machine reads the bytes 00 00 00 80 in memory and interprets this as the integer 0x00000080, which is 128 in decimal.
The exploit: The program sees a length of 128 (a small, seemingly safe number), and proceeds to allocate a buffer or use an existing buffer of that size. However, the attacker sends a much larger payload. When the program tries to copy the large payload into the small 128-byte buffer, it causes a buffer overflow. The attacker can now overwrite adjacent memory, including things like return addresses, to execute arbitrary code.

Summary: The Indirect Link
So, to be precise:
Direct Cause: A buffer overflow is directly caused by a memory copy or write operation that goes beyond the allocated memory for a buffer.
Contributing Factor: Failing to perform endianness conversion (with a SWAP operation or equivalent) can cause a program to misinterpret the size of a piece of data coming from a network or file. This misinterpretation can lead the program to allocate an undersized buffer, which is the direct cause of the buffer overflow.

Therefore, while the SWAP instruction itself is not a source of vulnerability, omitting it or using it incorrectly in a program that processes untrusted data can create a dangerous vulnerability that attackers can exploit to cause a buffer overflow.
