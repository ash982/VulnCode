memcpy:
a fundamental function in C and C++, known for its raw speed. However, its power comes with significant risks. Understanding the good and bad patterns is crucial for writing safe and correct code.
  
Good Patterns (When to Use memcpy)
The core principle of a good memcpy is copying blocks of simple, non-owned, raw data between non-overlapping memory regions.

1. Copying Plain Old Data (POD) or Trivial Types
This is the primary and safest use case for memcpy. POD types (in C) or Trivial types (in C++) are data structures without complex logic like constructors, destructors, or virtual functions. Think of them as just collections of bytes.
✅ Good Example: Copying a simple struct - safe1.c

2. Bulk Copying of Primitive Arrays
When you need to copy a large chunk of a simple array, memcpy is often the fastest way to do it.
✅ Good Example: Copying an array of integers - safe2.c

3. Interfacing with Hardware or Network Buffers
When reading from or writing to hardware, network sockets, or files, you are often dealing with raw byte buffers. memcpy is the standard tool for moving data between these buffers and your program's structs.
✅ Good Example: Deserializing data from a network buffer - safe3.c

==============================================================================================================
Bad Patterns (When to AVOID memcpy)
The core principle of a bad memcpy is copying memory that has complex structure, ownership, or overlapping regions.

1. The #1 Anti-Pattern: Overlapping Memory Regions
The behavior of memcpy is undefined if the source and destination memory regions overlap. It might work, it might corrupt your data, or it might crash.
❌ Bad Example: Shifting data in an array - bad1.c
Rule of Thumb: If there's any chance the source and destination might overlap, use memmove.

2. Copying Non-Trivial C++ Objects
This is the most dangerous C++ anti-pattern. memcpy knows nothing about constructors, destructors, or copy-assignment operators. It performs a "shallow copy," which can lead to memory leaks, double-frees, and corrupted state.
❌ Bad Example: Copying an object containing a std::string or std::vector - bad2.c
✅ The Correct Way: Use the C++ copy constructor or copy assignment operator.

3. Causing Buffer Overflows
This is a classic and severe security vulnerability. It happens when you copy more bytes than the destination buffer can hold.
❌ Bad Example: Unchecked size from an external source - bad3-BufferOverflows.c
✅ The Correct Way: Always validate the size before copying.
For a safer alternative, consider memcpy_s if your platform supports it (part of C11 Annex K).

Summary Table
Pattern	            Good (memcpy) or Bad (memmove/other)? Why?
Copying POD structs	✅ Good	Structs are simple blocks of memory. This is the ideal use case.
Copying arrays	    ✅ Good	Efficient for bulk copying of primitive data.
Overlapping memory	❌ Bad (Use memmove)	memcpy has undefined behavior for overlapping regions. memmove is guaranteed to work.
C++ objects	        ❌ Bad (Use copy constructor/assignment)	memcpy causes shallow copies, skips constructors/destructors, leading to leaks and crashes.
Unchecked sizes	    ❌ Bad (Validate size first)	Leads to buffer overflows, a major security risk.
Serialization       ✅ Good (with caution)	Useful for raw data, but not portable due to endianness, padding, and pointer sizes.

Buffer Overflows

The fundamental vulnerability it presents is the buffer overflow, and proper size checking is the direct countermeasure.
The number of bytes to copy (count) must never exceed the size of the destination buffer.

Secure Patterns for Size Checking
Pattern 1: The min Approach (Truncation is Acceptable)
This is the most common and robust solution. You determine the safe amount to copy by choosing the smaller of the two sizes: the source length or the destination capacity. This effectively truncates the input if it's too large.
✅ C Implementation (using ternary operator): fix1-BufferOverflows.c
✅ C Implementation (using ternary operator): fix2-BufferOverflows.cpp

Pattern 2: The Guard Condition (Truncation is an Error)
Sometimes, truncating data is not acceptable, and you should treat an oversized input as an error. In this pattern, you check the size first and refuse to perform the copy if the input is too large.
✅ C/C++ Implementation: fix3-BufferOverflows.c
