## ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) vs. ASP.NET Web API (Web Application Programming Interface)
Here is a breakdown of the differences between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API:

| Feature | ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) | ASP.NET Web API (Web Application Programming Interface)
|:--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary | Purpose	To build full-stack web applications that render the UI (HTML) on the server side. | To build services that expose data and business logic over HTTP.
| Output Type | Primarily returns HTML views. Can return JSON/XML, but less common. | Primarily returns structured data (JSON or XML) for consumption by other applications.
| Client Type | Typically consumed by a web browser that renders the HTML. | Consumed by various HTTP clients: mobile apps, single-page applications (SPAs), or other servers.
| Protocol Focus | Primarily focused on serving content for GET and handling form submissions (POST). | Strongly focused on RESTful design (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
| Base Class (Old) | Inherited from System.Web.Mvc.Controller | Inherited from System.Web.Http.ApiController
| Base Class (Core) | Typically inherits from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller (which adds view support on top of ControllerBase). | Typically inherits from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase.

**Key Takeaway in ASP.NET Core**
In modern ASP.NET Core, the two concepts are unified. Both MVC controllers (for views) and Web API controllers (for data) use the same routing, model binding, and dependency injection infrastructure.

1) If your controller inherits from `Controller` (as opposed to ControllerBase), it gains helper methods for working with views (like return View()).

2) If your controller inherits from `ControllerBase` (which is what the `[ApiController]` attribute usually enforces), it's optimized purely for data endpoints, returning results like Ok(), NotFound(), or Json().

looking for public methods in classes inheriting from Controller or ControllerBase, as both are fundamentally capable of hosting action methods.

## ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) vs. ASP.NET Core
The core difference is that ASP.NET MVC refers to an architectural pattern that ran on the older, Windows-only .NET Framework, whereas ASP.NET Core is the entire, new, unified platform that is cross-platform.

Think of it this way:

ASP.NET MVC (Old) = A specific type of car (the MVC pattern) built on an old engine (.NET Framework).

ASP.NET Core (New) = The new, modern, lightweight engine (the Core platform) that can run many types of car, including an updated MVC car (called ASP.NET Core MVC).

In short, when people today talk about "ASP.NET MVC," they are usually referring to ASP.NET Core MVC, which is the modern implementation of the Model-View-Controller pattern running on the powerful and flexible ASP.NET Core platform. The original "ASP.NET MVC" running on the old .NET Framework is now considered legacy.

Here are the key differences:

**1. The Platform**  
| Feature| Older ASP.NET MVC (e.g., MVC 5)| Modern ASP.NET Core
|:--- | :--- | :--- |
| Framework| Required the .NET Framework| Runs on .NET (Core) (e.g., .NET 8, .NET 9)
| Operating System| Windows-only| Cross-Platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
| Web Server| Tied heavily to IIS| Self-hosting capable, typically uses the built-in, fast Kestrel web server
| Dependencies| Heavily reliant on the monolithic System.Web.dll| Modular and relies on lightweight NuGet packages

**2. Architecture and Performance**  
ASP.NET Core was rebuilt from the ground up to address the limitations of the older framework.

Unification: In the old system, you had separate frameworks for ASP.NET MVC (for views) and ASP.NET Web API (for data). ASP.NET Core unifies these into a single framework using ControllerBase.

Modularity: You only include the features you need (like middleware, logging, etc.) via NuGet packages, leading to a much smaller application footprint and better performance.

Performance: ASP.NET Core applications are significantly faster and consume less memory than their predecessors, largely due to the lightweight Kestrel server and optimized middleware pipeline.

**3. Execution Model**  
| Concept| Older ASP.NET MVC| Modern ASP.NET Core
|:--- | :--- | :--- |
| Configuration| Uses XML-based web.config and the complex Global.asax| Uses code-based configuration (e.g., appsettings.json) and the clean Program.cs startup file.
| Routing| Separate routing systems for MVC and Web API| Unified routing system (Endpoint Routing) for all controller types.
| Dependency Injection| Required third-party containers (like Ninject or Unity)| Has built-in Dependency Injection support from the start.
